Cafe Manager System
Overview
Cafe Manager System is a comprehensive web-based application tailored to streamline the management of cafes and bistros. Its primary objective is to digitize the traditionally manual tasks associated with cafe operations, enhancing efficiency and ensuring a smoother customer experience.

Purpose:
The system is designed to address several challenges faced by cafe owners and managers:

Order Management: Keeping track of multiple orders, especially during peak hours, can be daunting. Our system provides a seamless interface to handle and monitor orders in real-time.
Inventory and Product Management: With an integrated product and category management feature, cafe managers can effortlessly add, update, or remove items, ensuring that the menu remains current and stock levels are maintained.
User Management: Differentiating between user roles is crucial in a cafe setting. The Cafe Manager System offers distinct access levels for 'admins' and 'users', enabling role-specific functionalities and privileges.
Billing and Payments: The integrated billing system automates the calculation process, reducing human error and expediting the payment process.
Main Features:
Dashboard: A centralized hub that offers a snapshot of the cafe's operations, from recent orders to inventory levels.
Best Seller Insights: Empowers cafe owners with data-driven insights into their best-performing items.
Authentication System: A robust login, signup, and password recovery mechanism ensuring data security.
Material Components: Dialogs for real-time notifications, manage categories for inventory structuring, order management for streamlined operations, and a detailed billing view for transparency.
